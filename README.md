# Exploratory Data Analysis of Wildfires in Mexico from 1970 to 2023

## By: Carlos Varela

## Introduction

Wildfires are a critical environmental issue that impact ecosystems, wildlife, and the mexican communities. Understanding the patterns and trends in wildfire occurrences can help in developing effective strategies for prevention and management. This project focuses on the analysis of wildfire data in Mexico from 1970 to 2023. The dataset includes information on the number of wildfires, the area burned (in hectares), and the geographic distribution of these fires across various states and regions.

## Purpose of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA is a crucial step in the data analysis process. It involves examining the data in a systematic way to uncover underlying patterns, identify anomalies, test hypotheses, and check assumptions through summary statistics and graphical representations. The main objectives of EDA in this project are:

1. **Data Quality Assessment**: Evaluating the quality and completeness of the data to identify any issues that may need to be addressed before further analysis or modeling. 
2. **Understanding the Distribution of the Data**: Gaining insights into the distribution of the data. Profiling our set through bins, histograms and box plots.
3. **Identifying Trends and Patterns**: Analyzing temporal trends in forest fire occurrences and burned areas to understand how these have evolved over time.
4. **Seasonal Variations**: Investigating seasonal patterns in wildfire occurrences to determine if there is seasonality to the appearance or increase of fires.
5. **Correlation Analysis**: Exploring relationships between different variables, such as the number of fires and the area burned, to identify potential correlations.
6. **Modeling Analysis**: Examining if our dataset can be used to train a machine learning algorithm for regression tasks

By conducting EDA, we aim to build a solid understanding of the dataset, which will inform subsequent data processing, analysis, and modeling steps. Ultimately, the insights gained from this analysis can contribute to more effective wildfire management and prevention strategies.

## How to access the data 

For this project we will use a dataset of free-use lincense provided by the Government of Mexico located in this website: https://datos.gob.mx/busca/dataset/incendios-forestales/resource/f88e952a-852c-4615-ac18-d3a87811d529

The data was collected by "CONAFOR" or Comision Nacional Forestal, which is a department of the Mexican Federal Government that provides support from the "PRONAFOR" Program. It is a Decentralized Public Organization of SEMARNAT or "Secretariat of Environment and Natural Resources".

To replicate the notebook, unzip the raw data files into the raw_data folder.
